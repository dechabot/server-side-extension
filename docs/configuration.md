# Configuring SSE plugins in Qlik

## Qlik Sense
You must configure SSE plugins, referred to by Qlik as analytic connections, in the Qlik Management Console (QMC) or using the Qlik Repository Service API. After you add a new analytic connection, you must restart the Qlik engine.

For an overview of analytic connections, see [Analytic connections](http://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/November2017/Content/AnalyticConnections.htm) in the Qlik Sense Developers help.

For instructions of adding a new SSE plugin in QMC, see [Creating an analytic connection](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/November2017/Subsystems/ManagementConsole/Content/create-analytic-connection.htm) in the Qlik Sense help.

For information about SSE plugins for Qlik Sense Desktop, see [Configuring analytic connections in Qlik Sense Desktop](http://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/November2017/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Introduction/configure-analytic-connection-desktop.htm) in the Qlik Sense help.


## QlikView

You must configure SSE plugins, referred to by Qlik as analytic connections, by editing the settings.ini file (either for QlikView Server or QlikView Desktop). After you add a new analytic connection, you must restart QlikView.

For an overview of analytic connections, including how to add a new SSE plugin, see [Analytic connections](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/qlikview/November2017/Subsystems/Client/Content/Analytic_connections.htm) in the QlikView help.
